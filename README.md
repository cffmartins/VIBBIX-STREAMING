<strong> VIBBIX </strong> is my movie and TV series streaming website, developed as the final project of the React module. This project serves to enhance my skills in modern web development using React and external API integrations.

<strong> This project focuses on building proficiency in: </strong>

- React (components, props, hooks, routing)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+ features)
- HTML and CSS (layout, styling, and structure)
- Consuming and integrating external APIs to deliver dynamic content
